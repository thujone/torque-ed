Training Ideas for Automotive Instruction

Helping you do what you do best
This training system should require minimal effort from the instructor to be prepared and effective in the classroom. CTE instructors shine in the shop setting, where they can bring all their years of industry experience. However, CTE instructors may not have had the training or expertise to be effective in the classroom. Therefore, we must create a learning system that supports the instructor and frees them up for hands-on experience with their students.

Lesson Plans:
Create lesson plans using several different learning strategies, allowing the instructor to pick and choose based on what is best for the student's learning styles that semester or year.
Our company will "custom fit" lesson plans for instructional staff and the number of meeting times for the class. Consultants - master teachers will help bring instructors up to speed with the most effective teaching strategies.

Create a repository of automotive lesson plans and bugging car ideas, and create a forum for automotive instructors using our platform to communicate with each other. 

Task Sheets:
They must be created for use by a tablet with a camera, typed into, and used with a stylus, just like modern service writing software for shops. They also must have a quick inspection sheet that allows reports to be generated.
Consultants will help set up cars or sell stand-alone trainers that integrate the learning software.

Service Writing function:
The training software must operate just like in a dealership or independent shop. The task sheets are part of the repair order the student must complete for credit.

Student Tracking: 
The system will track students through the training program, including task completion, surveys, and job placement… meeting all the Natef program requirements.

Advisory Board:
The software will house all advisory board meeting agendas, minutes, recordings, and sign-in sheets.

Subject Matter: 
The subject matter for the A1-A8 hasn't changed in decades. Maybe we could buy it from a publisher and update it. Then, we need to create content using a modern tick-tock style and long-form YouTube videos with high production value explaining each part or system, not in a lecture style but in the most effective way with young learners. Host videos across platforms (TikTok and YouTube), monetize them, and use videos to market our training.
Emulate Honda factory training, where the shop is used to complete the practical portion of the training. The theory of operation takes place online. There are no more lectures. Students take responsibility for their learning. Shop space and resources are limited. Students schedule time in the shop and complete curated assignments and tasks. Instructors are standing by to provide assistance and to help with additional learning.
Maybe agreements with Electude and VR training for distance learning.
Both men and women should demonstrate videos with live work.
School Sims idea. We follow a tech go through the diagnostic process for various situations.

Natef required tools:
We offer quotes for a tool kit that can transform a shop from nothing to what is required for Natef certification at each level. The kit is for MLR, AST, and MAST. The tools are purchased through us.

Student Learning Outcomes:
Tracking through grades on task sheets. Showing alignment to college accreditation.

Task sheets:
Student completion must be tracked across the program of study and not based on each class or teacher.  It has to be tracked across the program. There needs to be a way to grade the task sheets as they are completed, and those scores must be automatically recorded in the grade book and the task tracking database. Tasksheets will be electronic. Tablets will be used to record all information and take pictures and videos documenting their diagnoses and repair.

Student ID Cards:
Students will be issued an ID card scanned when they arrive at class to track, record, and store attendance in the database. Toolroom inventory usage is stored in the database—tool checkout to students tracking using an ID card.
Create "the transmission bench"-style videos where students watch the video to disassemble, inspect, and reassemble engines, transmissions, differentials, and transfer cases….

Student Uniforms with name tags.
Become a platform like NC3. Create curriculums that generate an "industry certification" that ties tools associated with it. We sell these as stand-alone packages.
Create a marketplace for students to purchase a curated assortment of tools at a major discount.

Orientation
All new students shall be required to attend orientation. Used to set expectations, meet with counselors, ed plan, how to navigate peoplesoft, ASE Certification, promise program, financial aid.

Social Media Integration	
Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. 

Social Aspects for Students
Award ceremonies, Recognize prior student achievements. End of semester Party, ASB Club, Allow student cars to be worked on during one weekend a month. Group photos. Instructor photos. Prior student guest speakers. Auto Club. Trips to SEMA for high achievers.  

The database of student info should contain the following:
Student Profile
Contact info: email, LinkedIn, address, cell number Attendance Tracking NATEF task sheet completion Student course completion NATEF student survey
“Constant Contact” emails - marketing, job opportunities, advanced training opportunities

Data Files:
Student Surveys
Employer Surveys
Industry board meeting agendas and minutes.

Suggestions 
Incorporate instructor feedback during development to ensure usability and practical relevance of lesson plans and tools.
	•	Add a structured mentorship or peer-learning component for students, allowing them to learn collaboratively.
	•	Consider pilot programs at select institutions to test implementation and refine the system before full rollout.
Create our own apprenticeship.
