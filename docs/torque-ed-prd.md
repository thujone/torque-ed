# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# TorqueEd (Automotive Education CMS)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Author:** Rich Goldman (rich@comfypants.org)  
**Status:** In Development - Phase A

## 1. Executive Summary

TorqueEd is a comprehensive school management system designed specifically for automotive education programs at colleges. Phase A is currently in development and focuses on core administrative functions and attendance tracking through QR code scanning. The system will enable administrators to manage schools, courses, classes, and students while providing robust, real-time attendance tracking. The development includes implementing a clock-in/clock-out attendance system that tracks student presence time through smart QR scanning that automatically detects clock-in vs clock-out actions, with manual override capabilities for instructors. Phase B will introduce grading capabilities, and Phase C will add comprehensive coursework tracking.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming and error-prone
- No centralized system for managing multiple schools within a district
- Difficult to track students across multiple classes and semesters
- Limited visibility into attendance patterns and student engagement
- Manual creation and maintenance of attendance spreadsheets
- Need for tracking actual time spent in class (clock-in/clock-out)
- Complex requirements for midterm and final session identification

### Target Users
1. **Super Administrators** - Technology staff managing the entire system
2. **Administrators** - Department heads managing schools and courses
3. **Instructors** - Teachers managing their classes and tracking attendance
4. **Teaching Assistants** - TAs helping with attendance tracking
5. **Students** - (Future consideration for limited access)

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Reduce attendance tracking time by 80%
2. Eliminate manual spreadsheet creation and maintenance
3. Provide real-time attendance visibility across all classes
4. Enable efficient student roster management
5. Implement clock-in/clock-out tracking with session duration
6. Support manual override capabilities for teachers

### Success Metrics
- Time to mark attendance for a 30-student class: < 2 minutes
- System uptime: 99.9%
- User adoption rate: 100% within first semester
- Data accuracy: 100% for attendance records
